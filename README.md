# Why use Scribe?

### Dead Simple

Who said OAuth was difficult? Configuring scribe is __so easy your grandma can do it__! check it out:

```java
OAuthService service = new ServiceBuilder()
                                  .provider(LinkedInApi.class)
                                  .apiKey(YOUR_API_KEY)
                                  .apiSecret(YOUR_API_SECRET)
                                  .build();
```

That **single line** (added newlines for readability) is the only thing you need to configure scribe with LinkedIn's OAuth API for example.

### Threadsafe

Hit Scribe as hard and with many threads as you like.

### Supports all major 1.0a and 2.0 OAuth APIs out-of-the-box

* Google

* Facebook

* Yahoo

* LinkedIn

* Twitter

* Foursquare

* Evernote

* Vimeo

* Yammer

* Windows Live

* and many more! check the [examples folder](http://github.com/fernandezpablo85/scribe-java/tree/master/src/test/java/org/scribe/examples)

### Small and modular

Scribe's code is small (about 1k LOC) and simple to understand. No smart-ass or "clever" hacks here.

### Android-Ready

Works out of the box with android(TM) applications.

### Stable & bulletproof

Good test coverage to keep you safe from harm.

When something bad actually happens, Scribe's meaningful error messages will tell you exactly what went wrong, when and where.
